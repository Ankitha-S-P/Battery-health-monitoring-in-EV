# Battery health monitoring in EV
This project is a Battery Health Monitoring System designed to ensure the optimal performance and safety of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The system uses the following components:
-Potentiometers: Two potentiometers measure battery voltage and current.
-DHT22 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity to monitor environmental conditions.
-LED Bulb: Provides visual warnings when battery parameters exceed safe thresholds.
-Relay Switch: Controls power flow and integrates with the warning system.
-SSD Display Board: Shows real-time battery status and alerts.

Simulation and Control:
- The system simulation was implemented using Wokwi, a platform for online electronics simulation.
- Real-time control and system status monitoring were managed through Blynk, allowing users to receive alerts and view battery health metrics remotely.
